# Readme

## Purpose
This is a practice exercise in implementing a Trie. Its purpose is to practice algorithms and data structures. 

For reference, here is a brief explanation of [Tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie). 

## To Use
### Note
Interactions with this exercise use the tool JShell, which is part of the JDK, which implements a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL) that is accessible through CLI. 

1) Navigate to `Java-trie/tries` directory

2) Compile Node
>`$javac -d . Node.java`

> (Node is imported into Trie, so it must be compiled first.)

3) Compile Trie 
>`$javac -d . Trie.java`

4) To run from CLI:
>`$ java tries.Trie`
